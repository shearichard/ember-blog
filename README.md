This repository contains the content for the [Ember.js Blog](https://blog.emberjs.com). It is built using [empress-blog](https://github.com/empress/empress-blog) and the styles are provided by [empress-blog-ember-template](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-ghost-ember-template)

Other parts of the public website are separate apps:

- [The Website](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website)
- [API Docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs)
- [Deprecations](https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app)
- [The Guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source)

## Contributing

New contributors are welcome! All of the Ember.js websites are maintained by an all-volunteer team, and we are thankful for your help.

The best way to get started is to find issue labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted." If you have questions or want a buddy to pair with, drop by the #dev-ember-learning channel on the
[Ember Community Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS).
Like most open source projects, contributors are encouraged to open an issue
to propose changes and iterate on ideas before investing time in coding.

[Making your first pull request](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-your-first-pull-request) in the Guides respository.
